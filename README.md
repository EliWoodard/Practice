## Notes
- C++
    - To run C++ run ```g++ -o anyContainerName program.cpp```
    - Then run ```.\anyContainerName``` and it will print the contents of that file.
    - In my example you would run ```g++ -o myprogram main.cpp and then .\myprogram exe```
    - This is after you have installed MinGW and set the Path.
- JS
    - To run javascript run Node main.js or any file name.js
- R
    - To get R running I installed R [Here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - I then went to my path variables for system to add the R bin folder.
    - To run R now I use Rscript <fileName.R>
